# Day Planner Project
The project demonstrates the use of JQuery, which is a JavaScript library that helps to work with the HTML DOM. The project consists of creating a daily agenda to keep events pending during a normal business day. JQuery is used in this project to create HTML elements like divs, textareas, buttons, including their attributes, which at the same time are related to a specific CSS configuration.

## How to use the application
The operation is simple, you only need to write the event or events in each row that represents a time of normal business hours, then click the save button related to that time and the events are saved.

The application also uses the moment.js library to display the current day and highlight the current time. Past and future hours are also identified by different colors.

Also, the app resets events when a new day starts. Information can be stored and reset in the scheduler by using the document's LocalStorage property.

## Summary
This a representative project for a front-end application using JQuery. The code can be efficiently reduced using the library. I enjoyed working on the project is simple but clever.
